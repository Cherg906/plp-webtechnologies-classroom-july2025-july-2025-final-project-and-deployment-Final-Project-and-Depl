## Responsive Design

- **Mobile-first approach** with CSS media queries.  
- Layouts adapt to different screen widths:  
  - Small devices: content stacked vertically, nav links wrap.  
  - Medium devices: padding and font sizes increased.  
  - Large/Extra-large devices: hero height, cards, buttons, and text scale up for readability.  
- Images and slideshows are **fully responsive** using `max-width: 100%` and `object-fit: cover`.

---

## Dark Mode

- Toggle dark mode via the 🌙 button.
- Changes background colors and text colors site-wide.  
- Implemented using CSS class `.dark-mode` and optional JavaScript to adjust form and tip backgrounds.
